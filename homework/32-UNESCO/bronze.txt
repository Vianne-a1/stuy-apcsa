Input Parsing: Extract data from the input file including pasture dimensions (R, C), target elevation (E), initial elevations of each square, and stomp-digging instructions.

Creating Pasture Grid: Establish a 2D array to represent the pasture, using initial elevations.

Stomp-Digging Handling: Process stomp-digging instructions by iterating through them. Adjust the elevations within the 3x3 grid specified by each instruction, ensuring boundary cases are handled correctly.

Depth Calculation: Determine the depth of each square relative to the target elevation. If a square's elevation exceeds the target, set its depth to 0; otherwise, calculate the difference.

Total Depth Calculation: Aggregate the depths of all squares to ascertain the total lake depth.

Volume Calculation: Compute the volume by multiplying the total depth by the area of each square (6 feet by 6 feet).

Outputting Result: Present the calculated volume as the final outcome.

File Handling: Manage input reading from one file and output writing to another file, as specified.

Testing with Sample Input: Validate the program's accuracy using the provided sample input.

Optional Optimization: Enhance code efficiency if necessary, considering input size constraints.
