__Questions:__
What do you notice about the mySum value?
> The mySum value is not 0.3 which is what math would traditionally would give you.

What is the value of checkResult, and why do we get that result?
> The value of checkResult is false. mySum resulted in a value that is greater than 0.3 therefore making it not equivalent.
