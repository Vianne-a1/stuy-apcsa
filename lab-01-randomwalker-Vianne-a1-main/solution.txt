Write at least one paragrath explaining your solution in the file solution.txt. Please be clear.

First, we create a Scanner to get the user input for n, the number of steps. Then, we have to create a for loop based on n. 
We'll create two variables to track the movement of the drone, one called xCor and one called yCor. These will be updated during each iteration of the for loop.
This for loop will iterate from 0 to n, and each time, we will make the computer choose a random double from 0 to 1. 
If this double is in the range of [0, 0.25), then it moves right 1 unit, meaning that we will add 1 to xCor. 
If this double is in the range of [0.25, 0.50), then it moves up 1 unit, meaning that we will add 1 to yCor.
If this double is in the range of [0.50, 0.75), then it moves left 1 unit, meaning that we subtract 1 from xCor. 
If this double is in the range of [0.75, 1.00), then it moves down 1 unit, meaning that we subtract 1 from yCor. 
At the end of the for loop, we return the final xCor and yCor. Based on these, we make a variable called Distance that will use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate
the distance between the two points.
