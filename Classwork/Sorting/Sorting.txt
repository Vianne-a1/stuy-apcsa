Pusedo code for the sorting algorithm.
Takes first value and sets a new variable (named minimum) equal the the first value in the array
Loop thorugh the code and array.
    If the int i is less than the value of minimum, the value of minimum is then replaced with the new minimum.
    If the int i is more than or equal to the value of minimum, then move onto the next value in the array as per the loop.
